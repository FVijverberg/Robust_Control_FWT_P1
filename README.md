# Robust Control SC42145 – Practical Assignment  
## Control Design for a Floating Wind Turbine

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation for the **Practical Assignment** of the course **Robust Control (SC42145)** at **Delft University of Technology**.  
The project focuses on designing and evaluating advanced control strategies for a **floating offshore wind turbine**, addressing challenges such as platform motion, environmental disturbances, and sensitivity to modelling uncertainties.

The repository includes:
- State-space modelling of the floating wind turbine system  
- PID, Mixed Sensitivity H∞ and Fixed Structure controller design  
- Open-loop and closed-loop validation  
- Time-domain simulations  
- Controller analysis using robustness metrics (gain/phase margins, singular values)  
- MATLAB Live Scripts (`.mlx`) and `.m` files for reproducibility
